# Difference between Hub, Switch and Router

it is very important to understand the difference between devices like hubs, switches, and routers.

## What is Hub?

A [Hub](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-hub/) is just a connector that connects the wires coming from different sides. It is an electronic device that operates only on physical layers of the [OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/).

It is also known as a repeater as it transmits signal to every port except the port from where signal is received. Also, hubs are not that intelligent in communication and processing information for 2nd and 3rd layer.


## What is Switch?

Switch is a point to point communication device. It operates at the [data link layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer/) of OSI model. 

Basically, it is a kind of [bridge](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bridge-in-computer-network-types-uses-functions-differences/) that provides better connections. It comes up with many features such as flooding, filtering and frame transmission.

## What is Router?

Routers are the multiport devices and more sophisticated as compared to repeaters and bridges.   determine which of several possible paths between the source and destination is the best for a particular transmission.

It works on the network layer 3 and used in LANs, MANs and WANs. It stores [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) and maintains address on its own.

## Frequently Asked Question Hub, Switch and Router – FAQ’s

### What is the main disadvantage of using hubs rather than switches?

> Hubs broadcast all information to all connected devices, which can cause ineffectiveness in a network or even collisions. On the other hand, switches send information only to the recipient to whom it is addressed, so they are much more effective.

### Why would a smart switch need to use a hub?

> Smart switches quite often require the use of a hub for managing and controlling several devices simultaneously; this is very true for smart home networks where some level of centralized control has to be achieved over the devices.

### What is the advantage of replacing a hub with a switch?

> Replacing the hub by a switch enhances the efficiency of a network by reducing collisions and ensues that the data is sent only to the receiver, not to other devices that have been connected in the network broadcast.

### Which is faster, the hub or the switch?

> Switches are faster than hubs because of the way they work on the Data Link Layer using MAC addresses, guiding the data only to the destination device to reduce unnecessary data traffic.
