## **Why test a network?**

A network can pose a significant security risk to businesses due to the amount of software and devices it interacts with. Vulnerabilities arise when a network has weaknesses that can be exploited by cyber attackers. These weak points can be found in a variety of places, such as servers, firewalls, routers, modems, physical connection ports, operating systems, and software updates. Any one of these could serve as a way for criminals to gain access to the network and cause damage to the business’s systems. 

Networks can face a range of threats. As such, it’s not possible to recognise a network cyber attack by only monitoring a certain piece of the infrastructure or a particular type of data. On top of this, networks often face multiple attacks employing different techniques at the same time. Potential network security threats include: 

- Malware 
- Viruses 
- Botnets 
- Keyloggers 
- Ransomware 
- SQL injection attacks 
- Man-in-the-middle attacks 
- Phishing attacks and social engineering 
- Physical surveillance and sabotage 

Network security is important as it protects personal data of employees and customers, as well as other information that can used to damage the business. Securing this data is vital, as it is often essential to everyday operations. In addition, if user data becomes compromised it can damage the integrity of the organization, possibly leading to customers going to other providers.





## **The process of a network test** 

The purpose of the test is to simulate how an attacker would go about gaining access to the network. In this, it aims to reveal any potential weaknesses that could be used as entry points. The information provided by the network test can then be used to devise targeted reinforcement plans. This will strengthen security in specific areas and implement targeted measures. 

When you run a test on your network with the help cyber security professionals, it will typically follow these steps: 

1. **Planning**  

We’ll first discuss with you what methods will be used in the test and how the results will be measured. Both these aspects will vary depending on the scope and goals of the test. At this stage, an ethical hacker will also identify the critical areas of your network that could contain vulnerabilities.  

      2. **Probing** 

The ethical hacker then starts using testing solutions to examine how the network responds to cyber attacks. For example, if there is an endpoint threat detection system the tester will become aware of it. This allows them to gain an understanding of how various parts of the network communicate, along with the nature of the response. The result is the ethical hacker now knows to operate in the way that’s most likely to bypass any automated defenses. 

      3. **Mock attacks** 

Following the appropriate network research, an ethical hacker will simulate a range of attacks. This can include any of the types of network threats already discussed. If a network vulnerability is found, they will then take actions to exploit the weakness such as attempting to disrupt traffic, increase privileges, and stealing data.  

The tester can then measure the vulnerability by how much theoretical damage they would be able to inflict. Time can be a factor here too. After gaining access, testers can try and make changes that lock internal administrators out of the network.  

      4. **Analysing the results**  

The test concludes once the tester is confident there isn’t any more information that can be gleaned about the network’s security. Following this, a report will be created to show their findings to the business owner. Testing reports contain insights into the vulnerabilities found, details of recommended remedial action, and the likely timeframe for solving any network problems.



## **Different types of network testing** 

All network tests will follow the general structure outlined above. However, there are variations based on the approach of the tester and the aspects focused on. These are: 

- **White box testing** – testers have an intimate knowledge of the network and how its infrastructure has been constructed. They’re therefore primarily concerned with examining code implementation, control flow, data flow, error handling, and other technical features. 
- **Black box testing** – the tester lacks any prior knowledge of the organisation’s network or systems. As such, this method is the most effective at simulating the effects of an actual cyber attack.  
- **Grey box testing** – unsurprisingly, this combines elements of both white and black box testing. The ethical hacker is given a select amount of information about the network. Grey box tests are ideal for assessing the risk privileged users pose to the business.
